OpenDataSTL is partnering with GlobalHack on their first civic-focused hackathon this weekend September 11-13. GlobalHack teams will work together with the Civic Tech for Social Impact Collaborative - including St. Louis County, Rise Community Development, and OpenDataSTL - to create technology solutions to make it easier for people to navigate the criminal justice system and resolve their issues faster.

There's still time to [register and join us](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/globalhack-v-tickets-17287634781)! See you tonight.
