Welcome to OpenDataSTL!  

We are a local, volunteer brigade of Code for America, a non-profit organization of citizens, technologists and public servants working together to address civic and community issues through open data and technology.

Get involved by coming to [our next meetup] (http://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-STL/).
