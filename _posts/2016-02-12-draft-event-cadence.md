Here are some notes I have from our last meeting  
 
## Brigade Focuses 
It might be helpful for the brigade to have these focuses:  
  
 *  **Events + presentations**: Connecting with other meetup groups and providing resources for people to learn and contribute  
 *  **Projects + worknights**: Facilitating time + space for productive work  
 *  **A network of information + online resources** (i.e., a great website): Transferring knowledge from and information about the civic tech community locally and the CfA/brigade community (inter)nationally  
  
In this way, the group serves as an onramp for helping people discover and apply their interest in civic tech and community/government data.  
  
## Draft "Event Cadence" to work towards for 2016  
  
### Weekly Worknights  
These are obviously crucial, and need to be established in a way that's self-organizing/emergent, i.e., people decide on what they want to work on and are responsible for their own stuff/projects of interest. The group provides recommendations and resources for successful projects, but each individual projects has its own owner/champion/etc.  
  
It would be cool to have weekly worknights coincide with Venture Cafe, so maybe 6-9pm on Thursday at either CIC or CET.  
To stay beginner-friendly and somewhat focused, each week would also have a general theme, corresponding to the "contribute" trainings I've mentioned before:  
 *    Week 1) Getting involved: version control, front-end design, contributing content (git intro, digital front door work, jekyll and content)  
 *    Week 2) Exploring Data: visualization, analysis, discovery, access, policy, wrangling, and cleaning (intro the community portal, d3, policy development)  
 *    Week 3) Ideas and projects: pitching ideas, project status updates, Civic Tech Canvas  
 *    Week 4) Building Prototypes: design sprint overview, CivX progress, full stack fundamentals  
 *    Week 5) Civic Social: celebrate progress, relax and hang out, maybe job fair stuff?  
  
### Monthly Meetings  
Monthly meetings become monthly Civic Collaboratories (co-llabs) and strategy happy hours  
  
**Co-llabs**- Monthly project-based events where we partner with either 1) another meetup, 2) a rep from a government agency, or 3) an academic org, to explore creative applications of civic tech  
**Strategy happy hours** - Administrative stuff is moved to a regularly occurring but less formal meeting at Venture Cafe (just for example - they have free fancy soda)
