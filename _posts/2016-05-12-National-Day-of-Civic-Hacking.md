It's time to get ready for the National Day of Civic Hacking. This year we will be, once again, meeting at the 555 Washington building. This time there will be hardware hacking with the Rasberry Pi and training sessions on technologies like Linux and Ansible and git. You don't have to be an expert to participate. The essence of hacking is learning by exploring boundaries!
