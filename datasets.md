At its heart, OpenDataSTL is about freeing data and making cool stuff with it, about using technology to improve our communities and neighborhoods. Here are some of the datasets we have found or created, all free to use as you see fit. If you don't see a dataset listed that you have access to, or just would like to see, fill out the form and we'll get in touch with you to see what we can do!
